# Questionnaire-Based-Screening-Tool-Using-Machine-Learning-to-Predict-Risk-of-Dyslexia
Critical components of reading according to the National Reading Panel(2000) (a US government body): Phonemic awareness, Phonics, Fluency, Vocabulary, and Comprehension. My goal is to create a questionnaire based on these components to predict dyslexia using machine learning

The dataset we are using has a total of six features, which represents score of a subject on the different tests as indicated by the respective names: vocabulary, memory, speed, visual etc.

The project is divided in 2 stages. In first stage I will do exploratory data analysis on the data, train machine learning models on this dataset and tune the hyperparameters to get the best performing model. In the second step using the five critical components of reading in conjunction with the features in our dataset and create a questionnaire. Based on response time of a child answering the questions we will create the five features and use the best machine-learning model from the first step to make a prediction.

Disclaimer: 
● No screening tool can conclusively diagnose dyslexia without extensive human observation.
● Better questionnaire can be prepared with the help of professionals with domain knowledge
